# Group2 Web Project

## Project Overview
This project is a web-based application that predicts car prices using multiple **Machine Learning** methods, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Polynomial Regression. After evaluating the performance of each model, **Polynomial Regression** was chosen as it provided the best results.

## Features
- User authentication.
- Car price prediction using **Scikit-learn** regularized polynomial regression.
- Responsive design for both mobile and desktop using **Bootstrap**.
- **Flask** web API.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (Polynomial Regression, Linear Regression, Decision Trees)
- **Deployment**: Render
